# Serial Binary to BCD Converter


This project was developed as part of my **Microelectronics Master's** coursework at the University of Seville.  
It represents my **first complete Verilog verification exercise**, implemented and tested in **EDA Playground**.

---

## 🧠 Objective
Starting from a given Verilog design, the goals were to:
1. Develop a **testbench** to verify correct operation.
2. Detect and fix functional issues in the original RTL.
3. Document the debugging process and final results.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **EDA Playground** (Icarus Verilog)
- **GTKWave** for waveform analysis
- Source code written in **Verilog 2001**

---

## 📂 Files
- design/unit3_1_ori.v → Original design provided
- design/unit3_1_fixed.v → Corrected RTL (after debugging)
- tb/unit3_1_tb.v → Testbench with stimuli and comments
- docs/joscabsan_task3.pdf → Final report submitted for evaluation


---

## ⚙️ Verification Summary
- Implemented clock and reset signals in the testbench.
- Tested boundary cases and asynchronous reset.
- Verified correct BCD output and timing behavior → More details in docs/joscabsan_task3.pdf 
- Fixed race condition and reset handling issues.

---

## 🧩 Learnings
- Built my first functional verification flow in Verilog.
- Gained practical experience in RTL design and verification.
